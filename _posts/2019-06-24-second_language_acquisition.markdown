Learning a new language is like building a bridge to the unknown world. I am a second language learner myself. Growing up I have learned English since I started school. After graduating college, I took the opportunity of learning another language: Japanese. I decided to go to Japan and enrolled in a Japanese Language Course. I clearly remember that on my first day of school the only Japanese I knew was “Konnichiwa” which translates to “Hello” and “Arigatou Gozaimasu” which is “Thank you”. I was sent to a classroom filled with 25  or more students from different countries all of whom already knew basic phrases. Our lessons started and I was just looking at the teacher with so much confusion on my face as if to say “I have no idea what you’re saying right now.” I went home feeling frustrated thinking “Did I just make a wrong decision? Did I just waste my time and money getting here?”. 

I thought of the value of education growing up. Being a diligent student and also that fact that I have no choice since I’m in a different country, I still went to school every day, just trying to get the gist of what the lesson is all about. I would get hints from classmates who can speak a little bit of English and who were helping me out. 

I was listening to the audio books the school provided, trying to practice everyday expressions, and writing Japanese characters over and over again until I remembered it. My life was like this for months. It was after  5 months or so of hard work and practice that I started to speak basic Japanese sentences. Finally by  that time when I went in the classroom and I could actually understand what some of my classmates were saying. It was also that time that I got more confident in using what I’ve been practicing. I  became independent and I didn’t need other people’s help just to order my food at a restaurant, ask questions when I get lost, and I actually started making friends. It was very rewarding. Looking back now, I feel really good about myself that I actually could speak the language of which I had no idea before. It really opened my eyes to a culture that until then I have just read in books. It was a learning discovery for me. I was in a different world. It changed me.

Now I venture into learning a new language, “Programming Languages”. Since I decided to start this program a month ago, it has not been an easy journey. It brings back my Japanese Language learning experience. I feel like I was put in a classroom where I have no idea what’s going on. As time goes by, I begin to understand little by little the technical jargon people use in this field. I am still on the early stage of this second language acquisition. I have yet to discover more and learn more of this new language. It’s a goal that I want to accomplish and it’s a skill that I know will be valuable to me. I know that the end result of this journey will be rewarding. 

Learning a new language is HARD but it is possible. You will have to undergo a rollercoaster of emotions until you can finally cross that bridge you build and being persistent is the key. You will have a lot of negative feelings at first. You will begin to doubt yourself and your decision. We all have the skills to understand things. We just need to push a little harder. I will end this blog by sharing you one of my dad’s favorite quotes of which he has repeated to me so many times growing up that it’s like a mantra now:*** “Winners never quit and quitters never win.” ***
